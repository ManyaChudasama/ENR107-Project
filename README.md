# ENR107-Project - LED VU Meter
# Problem Statement : In many audio-related applications, it's essential to have a real-time visual representation of sound levels to monitor audio signals effectively. This project aims to create a basic LED VU Meter which will act as a noise detector at various places using the sound sensor (LM393). The number of LEDs glowing and the intensity of the light will help us to represent the sound level of the background sounds and monitor the intensity of noise. 
# Features : With the help of number of glowing LEDs and its colour, we are able to detect the sound intensity of the area via sound sensor. With the rise in sound intensity, there is a rise in number of glowing LEDs. Along with coloured representation (high sound intensity - all LEDs glowing with red at the top indicating high amount of noise), there is LCD display to display the decibels of the sound detected.
